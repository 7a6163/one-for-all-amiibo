# one-for-all-amiibo

The one-for-all-amiibo tool allows you to easily merge multiple amiibo bin files into a single file. This can be useful if you have multiple amiibos that you want to use with an emulator or other software that supports amiibo files.

## Installation

You can download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/7a6163/one-for-all-amiibo/releases) on GitHub. There are pre-built binaries available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. Simply download the appropriate binary for your operating system and extract the archive.

## Usage

To use one-for-all-amiibo, simply run the binary and pass the paths of the input files as arguments. For example:


./one-for-all-amiibo input1.bin input2.bin input3.bin output.bin


This command will combine the data from `input1.bin`, `input2.bin`, and `input3.bin`, and write the resulting data to `output.bin`.


## Development

If you want to build one-for-all-amiibo from source, you will need to have Rust installed. You can then clone the repository and run the following command:


cargo build â€“release


This will build the binary in release mode, which is optimized for performance.
